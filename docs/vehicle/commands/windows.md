# Windows

## POST `/api/1/vehicles/{id}/command/window_control`

Controls the windows. Will vent or close all windows simultaneously.

`lat` and `lon` values must be near the current location of the car for
`vent` operation to succeed.  For `close`, the `lat` and `lon` values are
ignored, and may both be `0` (which has been observed from the app itself).
